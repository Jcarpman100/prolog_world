Wumpus World Report - Joseph Carpman

##   Introduction
>My solution can be described as a reflex agent that remembers where it has been and its percepts at those locations. Due to the small size of wumpus world, I decided against using an actual pathfinding algorithm after spending a few hours trying to make one work. My agent simply moves forward until something interesting happens or it can use the knowledge it has gained about the world. This is unlikely to give an optimal solution, but it will almost always present a solution when one exists, and it will never willingly walk into danger.
